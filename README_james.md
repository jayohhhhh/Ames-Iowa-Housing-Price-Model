- Does the README provide a good executive summary of the project?

## Problem Statement:
A real estate investor has consulted me as their data scientist to predict housing prices to determine which properties to invest in the Ames, Iowa area. They want to know what house features could affect the sale price the most and which features might be worth adding/renovating to the home to flip for maximum profit. 


## Summary:
The objective of this project is to fit home feature variables to models to predict their prices and narrow in on which ones affect and drive up the sale price of the home the most. Some examples of these variables are: Living Area, No. of Fireplaces, Area of Masonry Veneer, and more. With these predictions, the investor can determine which features of a home to remodel or add on to bring the most value to a home. The Investor has a wheel-house of contractors that can do work for him for a good price and would like to focus in on those capabilities. Those include: drywall, garage construction, fireplace installs. 

## Business Recommendations:
The investments should be focused around the following:
Homes that lack bathrooms per bedroom.
Homes with garages that require severe repairs or lack garages entirely.
Building up garage space to at least 400 sq ft. 
Homes lacking a fireplace.
Adding greater living space to homes that are under 1200 Sq Ft.
